Pathfinding Visualizer
------------

INTRODUCTION
------------
This app is built on Javascript, React, and CSS, to create a page that lets you visualize the sorting of randomly generated arrays with according sizes.
The project currently only uses one algorithm, merge sort algorithm (explained at the top of SortingAlgorithms.js) and the visualization is shown when the app is run. I have not deployed this project anywhere and it is still in early works but the fundamentals are understoodand implemented. I got the idea to make the project and learned to make most of what I have so far with the help of Clemente Mihailescu and his tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc. His original completed and deployed project can be found on https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer. 


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Because this project is still in early development, the repo must be cloned and npm must be used to run it. It is not hosted anywhere yet.
The requirements include Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 and get be obtained on https://nodejs.org/en/.


CONFIGURATION
------------
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
The app is currently run in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


PLANS + BUGS
-------------
There are currently no bugs.\
I plan to implement more algorithms along with the ones I have, play around with the animations and effects so that the project has more of my taste and personality to it, and will create a more usable and impressive UI and UX.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
